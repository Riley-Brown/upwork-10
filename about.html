    <p>Hi there. Thanks for visiting. My name is Doug Seidman. I am currently the Head of Product & Design at GQ.</p>

    <p>I have spent the last 5 good years at Condé Nast. I started out as the VP of Product & Design for Condé Nast
      Entertainment, Condé’s digital video department and transitioned over to GQ as the Head of Product & Design.
      Prior to that, I had spent over a year running my own design studio full-time, Scratch, which I founded in 2006
      as a side business for start-ups, and small & local businesses. I was also the design lead at Vevo since its
      inception, and a visual designer at several agencies including Huge, ID Society, and Draft FCB.</p>

    <p>My focus as both a designer and product manager is to always understand, communicate, and execute upon user
      behavior through both quantitate and qualitative research and analysis. I aim to bring the design and engineering
      process closely together, focusing on creating experiences (first and foremost) for the user, while just as
      importantly taking business and brand needs into consideration from the start. My goal is to always test, learn,
      and ship quality results effeciently.</p>

    <p>I graduated from West Virginia University with a degree in Graphic Design.</p>

    <p>I live in NYC with my wife, my 3 year old daughter, and my dog.</p>

    <p>In my next life, I plan on being the owner of an NBA team.</p>
